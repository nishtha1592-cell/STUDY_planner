# Student Planner & Study Tracker 

## Description
The *Student Planner Tool* is a comprehensive Python-based console application designed to assist university students in managing their academic workload effectively. 

In the chaotic environment of university life, keeping track of what topics have been studied and what deadlines are approaching is crucial. This tool acts as a digital logbook, allowing users to *log study sessions, **track specific topics, and **monitor progress*. By utilizing a local database system, it ensures that your study history is preserved across sessions, helping you stay organized and focused on your academic goals.

## Features
- *Smart Session Logging:*
  Easily add new study entries by specifying the Subject and the specific Topic covered. The system is designed for quick data entry to minimize distraction.

  The system automatically captures the current date and time for every entry. You do not need to type dates manually, ensuring accurate chronological tracking of your study habits.

- *Task Visualization (Dashboard):*
  View all your academic logs in a structured, easy-to-read table format. This helps in reviewing what subjects you have focused on recently and identifying areas that need more attention.

- *Data Persistence:*
  The application uses a file handling system (planner_data.txt) to save your progress automatically. Your data remains safe even after you close the program.

- *Clean User Interface:*
  A text-based menu-driven interface that is lightweight, fast, and free from distractions.
